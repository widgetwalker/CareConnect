CareConnect Project Overview
==========================

1. Project Description
---------------------
CareConnect is a modern web application designed to simplify healthcare access. It allows users to browse doctor profiles, book consultations (video/audio), and manage their health appointments through a personalized dashboard. The application features a responsive design with a dark mode aesthetic.

2. Technology Stack & Software Used
----------------------------------
A. Frontend Framework & Languages:
   - React (v18): The core library for building the user interface.
   - TypeScript: Adds static typing to JavaScript for better code quality and developer experience.
   - Vite: Next-generation frontend tooling for fast development and building.

B. Styling & UI:
   - Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI design.
   - Lucide React: A library for consistent and beautiful icons.
   - Radix UI (via Shadcn/UI patterns): Accessible, unstyled components for building high-quality design systems (used for Tabs, Cards, etc.).
   - Class Variance Authority (CVA): For managing component variants.

C. Backend & Database (BaaS):
   - Supabase: An open-source Firebase alternative providing:
     - Authentication: Secure user sign-up and sign-in services.
     - Database (PostgreSQL): Relational database for storing users, doctors, and appointments.
     - Real-time subscriptions (optional for future features).

D. Routing & State Management:
   - React Router DOM: Handles navigation between different pages (Home, Dashboard, Doctors, etc.).
   - React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext): Manages local state and side effects.

E. Development Tools:
   - Node.js & npm: Runtime environment and package manager.
   - ESLint: Pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX.

3. Project Structure

The project follows a standard React application structure:

4. How It Works (Key Workflows)
------------------------------
A. Authentication Flow:
   - Users sign up or sign in using email/password via the Supabase Auth API.
   - The application manages user sessions. Protected routes (like Dashboard) redirect unauthenticated users to Sign In.

B. Doctor Browsing & Selection:
   - The 'Doctors' page fetches a list of doctors from the Supabase database (or fallback data).
   - Users can filter doctors by specialty or search by name.
   - Clicking "Book" on a doctor card navigates to the Consultation page with that doctor pre-selected.

C. Appointment Booking:
   - The 'Consultation' page presents a form for the user to select a date, time, and consultation type.
   - Submitting the form triggers a function in `supabase-queries.ts` that inserts a new record into the `appointments` table in the database, linked to the user's ID.

D. Dashboard Management:
   - The 'Dashboard' page fetches the authenticated user's profile and appointments.
   - It displays upcoming appointments with the doctor's name, date, and status.
   - It handles data relationships (e.g., mapping Doctor IDs to names) to present a user-friendly view.

5. Database Schema (Supabase)
----------------------------
- `users` (Managed by Supabase Auth): Stores email and encrypted passwords.
- `user_profiles`: Stores additional user info (name, avatar).
- `doctors`: Stores doctor details (bio, specialty, rating).
- `appointments`: Links users and doctors with a date, status, and consultation type.

6. Getting Started / Running the Project
---------------------------------------
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Set up environment: Ensure `.env` contains valid `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
3. Run development server: `npm run dev`
4. Access the app at `http://localhost:8080` (or the port shown in terminal).
